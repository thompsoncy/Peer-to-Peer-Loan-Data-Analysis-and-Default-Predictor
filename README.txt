This is my Python final project for my Data Science 3000 Foundations of Data Science class taken in Spring 2019. I did this project with Vlad Koroviakovskyi, our individual contributions can be found in the contributions section of the jupyter notebook.

This project is an exploration of using various forms of machine learning to predict  defaults in a real world peer to peer loan dataset. Specifically this project used the Kaggle peer to peer loan dataset and tried to predict defaults based on a variety of factors, as well as using these methods for general analysis of the data.
